#2.2 Write a program that uses raw_input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them. Note that raw_input will pop a dialog box. Enter Sarah #in the pop-up box when you are prompted so your output will match the desired output below.

# The code below almost works

name = raw_input("Enter your name")
print "Howdy"

#2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to #test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about #error checking or bad user data.

# This first line is provided for you

hrs = raw_input("Enter Hours:")
rate = raw_input("Enter rate:")
print float(hrs) * float(rate)

if 4 < 4:
6
else:
4
